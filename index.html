        <h1>Our Future</h1>
        <div class="futureText">
            <p>Over the next two years, the Digital Analytics (DA) team at the Virginia Digital Maritime Center (VDMC) is poised to embark on a transformative journey focused on three key areas of research:</p>
    
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Integrated Shipyard Operations:</strong> The DA team will lead research initiatives aimed at optimizing shipyard operations through advanced modeling and simulation techniques, including the development of digital twins. This approach will create integrated virtual replicas of shipyard facilities and processes, enabling the optimization of workflows, resource allocation, and scheduling for enhanced efficiency and productivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shipyard Infrastructure Support:</strong> Building on their expertise in data analytics, the DA team will support and optimize shipyard infrastructure. This includes energy modeling and other aspects of infrastructure management. Through advanced modeling and simulation, the team will identify opportunities to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and resilience of shipyard infrastructure, contributing to improved operations and cost savings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Leveraging Legacy Knowledge for Future Maritime Advancements:</strong> The DA team will build on previous research efforts to help the maritime industry leverage knowledge gained from legacy practices while propelling it into the future. Through applied research, the team will integrate best practices and lessons learned from traditional maritime operations with cutting-edge technologies and methodologies. By bridging the gap between tradition and innovation, the team aims to drive continuous improvement and innovation within the maritime industry, ensuring its readiness to meet future challenges.
                </li>
            </ol>
    
            <p>By aligning our research efforts in these three key areas, the DA team aims to drive transformative change in the maritime industry, fostering efficiency, sustainability, and resilience throughout the maritime industry.</p>
